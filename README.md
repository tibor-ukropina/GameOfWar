# GameOfWar

This game of war was created using asynchronous javascript. The game of war is played between the user and the computer, both draw a card, and the card with the higher “value” is the winner. When the “New Deck” button is clicked a fetch get request is sent to deckofcardsapi.com, creating a brand new deck of cards with an original ID. When the “Draw” button is pressed the API is called again using the original deck ID drawing one card for the user and the computer.
